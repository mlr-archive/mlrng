```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(mlrng)
knitr::opts_knit$set(
  datatable.print.keys = FALSE,
  datatable.print.class = TRUE
)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
future::plan("sequential")
```

This introduction shows how to parallelize `mlrng` using the package [`future`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future).


# Parallel Resampling

The most outer loop in resampling runs independent repetitions of applying a learner on a subset of a task, predict on a different subset and score the performance by comparing true and predicted labels.
This loop is what is called embarrassingly parallel.

In the following, we will consider the spam task and a simple classification tree (`"classif.rpart"`) to illustrate parallelization.

```{r}
library("mlrng")
library("bench")

task = mlr.tasks$get("spam")
learner = mlr.learners$get("classif.rpart")
resampling = mlr.resamplings$get("subsampling")
measures = mlr.measures$get("mmce")

bench::system_time(
  resample(task, lrn, resampling, measure)
)
```
We now use the `future` package to parallelize the resampling by selecting a backend via the function `plan` and then repeat the resampling.
We use the "multiprocess" backend here which uses threads on linux/mac and a socket cluster on windows:
```{r, dependson = -1}
library("future")
plan("multiprocess")

bench::system_time(
  resample(task, lrn, resampling, measure)
)
```

On most multicore systems you should see a decrease in the reported real CPU time.

We can do the same for benchmarking:
```{r}
tasks = lapply(c("iris", "spam", "pima"), mlr.tasks$get)
learners = list(mlr.learners$get("classif.rpart"))
resamplings = list(mlr.resamplings$get("subsampling"))
measures = list(mlr.measures$get("mmce"))

plan("multiprocess")
bench::system_time(
  benchmark(tasks, learners, resamplings, measures)
)
```

# Running learner in a fail-safe way

With future as backend, it is also possible to run learners in an isolated R session.
If the learner crashed, e.g. with a SEGFAULT, it does not tear down the master session.

```{r}
library("future.callr")
plan("callr", timeout = 3)
task = mlr.tasks$get("spam")
learner = mlr.learners$get("classif.crashtest")

# FIXME: TBC
# options(future.wait.timeout = 5)
# train(task, learner)
```

# Building Blocks

The package provides R6 classes for the building blocks of machine learning:

* Tasks
* Learners
* Resamplings
* Performance Measures

All objects are stored in dictionaries (a.k.a. hash maps):
`mlr.tasks` comes with some predefined toy tasks, `mlr.learners` with learners, `mlr.resamplings` with different resampling methods and `mlr.measures` with some popular performance measures.

## Tasks

### Task Creation
We use the `iris` data set to create a multilabel classification task:
```{r}
iris.task = TaskClassif$new(data = iris, target = "Species")
```

### Task Object

Task objects come with some handy self-explanatory getters:
```{r}
# id
iris.task$id

# dimension
c(iris.task$nrow, iris.task$ncol)

# name of the target column
iris.task$target

# names of the feature columns
iris.task$features

# formula describing the task
iris.task$formula

# column types
iris.task$col.types

# number of classes
iris.task$nclasses

# class levels
iris.task$classes

# positive class (not feasible for multilabel classification)
iris.task$positive

# missing values per column
iris.task$missing.values

# peek into the data
iris.task$head()

# complete data
iris.task$data
```
In `mlrng`, tasks can rely on different data backends to hold tabular data.
Per default, data is stored in SQLite data bases where the data does not occupy any memory unless fetched from the data base.
This allows you to work with hundreds of tasks simultaneously or to conveniently learn on subsets of "big data".
If not configured differently, the temp directory of R is used to store the data base.
Alternatively, you can opt to hold the data in memory (for a small performance boost) or to connect to a real DBMS like PostgresSQL or MariaDB.
This is covered in detail in the help (FIXME).

The backend treats the data as immutable.
While some operations work without touching or querying the data (filtering rows or selecting columns), other (preprocessing) operations will create an in-memory copy of the data (or subset) on the fly.
```{r}
# subset to 120 rows and remove column "Petal.Length"
keep = setdiff(c(iris.task$target, iris.task$features), "Petal.Length")
iris.task$subset(rows = 1:120, cols = keep)

iris.task$nrow
iris.task$features
```
If you for example subsample your data first to only use 0.1% of all observations before preprocessing and feeding it into a model, you can keep the memory footprint reasonable.


### Predefined Tasks

The package ships with some popular tasks to toy around with.
Like most objects in `mlrng`, tasks are stored in a `Dictionary` which is called `mlr.tasks` here:
```{r}
print(mlr.tasks)
print(mlr.tasks$summary())
```
We use the `$get()` function to retrieve a specific task, here a regression task based on the dataset `BostonHousing`:
```{r}
bh.task = mlr.tasks$get("bh")
bh.task$head()
```


## Learners

Learners interface statistical learning algorithms which implement two steps:
In the first step, they are provided some training data to fit a model.
In the second step, this model is used to predict on data where the outcome is unknown.
Many popular learners a connected to `mlrng` in the package `mlrnglearners` (FIXME) to keep the dependency chain reasonable.

### Create Learners
Users and package authors can define their own learners (but be sure to check if someone else already did the job for you!).

Here, we create a new, simple learner which takes a classification problem and predicts the majority class.
Learners must follow the these conventions:
* The training function `train()` takes a task and a training subset.
  The `train()` function should only use the respective subset of the task to build the model.
  The return value can be an arbitrary R object which will be passed to `predict()`.
* The predict function `predict()` gets the return value of the train function as argument `model` and
  the data to predict on as argument `newdata`.

```{r}
lrn = LearnerClassif$new(
  name = "majority",
  properties = c("missings", "feat.factor", "feat.numeric"),

  train = function(task, subset, ...) {
    truth = task$get(subset, task$target)[[1L]]
    list(majority.class = names(which.max(table(truth))))
  },

  predict = function(model, newdata, ...) {
    rep.int(model$majority.class, nrow(newdata))
  }
)
```


### Predefined Learners

All learners are stored in a register called `mlr.learners` and can easily be listed:
```{r}
mlr.learners
mlr.learners$summary()
```

### Dummy classification learner

You can retrieve learners from the dictionary `Learners`:
```{r}
lrn.dummy = mlr.learners$get("classif.dummy")
```

The parameter set is stored in the slot `par.set` and parameters deviating from the default are stored in `par.vals`:
```{r}
lrn.dummy$par.set
lrn.dummy$par.vals
```

Now, we set the parameter `method` to `"sample"`, change the `id` and add the learner to the register:
```{r}
lrn.dummy$par.vals = list(method = "sample")
lrn.dummy$id = "classif.dummy.sample"
mlr.learners$add(lrn.dummy)
mlr.learners$summary()
```
From now on, we can just pass the id `"classif.dummy.sample"` to other functions to use this learner.

## Measures

```{r}
mlr.measures$summary()
measure = mlr.measures$get("mmce")
```

## Resampling

```{r}
mlr.resamplings
mlr.resamplings$summary()
r = mlr.resamplings$get("cv")
print(r)

# change to 3-fold cv
r$iters = 3
```

# Train and Predict

Here, we fit a simple CART on a random subset of the iris task.
The returned object is a `TrainResult`:
```{r}
task = mlr.tasks$get("iris")
lrn = mlr.learners$get("classif.rpart")
set.seed(123); train = sample(task$nrow, 120)
tr = train(task, lrn, subset = train)
print(tr)
tr$train.log
```
We can access the returned `rpart` model via the slot `$rmodel`:
```{r}
print(tr$rmodel)
```

Next, we can use the `TrainResult` to predict on the left-out observations:
```{r}
test = setdiff(1:task$nrow, train)
pr = predict(tr, subset = test)
```



# Resampling

```{r}
rr = resample(task = iris.task, learner = lrn.dummy, resampling = r, measures = list(measure))
rr$data
rr$aggr
```

# Benchmarking

```{r}
tasks = lapply(c("iris", "sonar"), mlr.tasks$get)
learners = lapply(c("classif.dummy", "classif.rpart"), mlr.learners$get)
resamplings = lapply("cv", mlr.resamplings$get)
measures = lapply("mmce", mlr.measures$get)

withr::with_options(list(mlrng.verbose = FALSE), {
  bmr = benchmark(
    tasks = tasks,
    learners = learners,
    resamplings = resamplings,
    measures = measures)
})
bmr$data
```
